### My Programming Environment Profile

------
Arch Linux [i3-gaps + i3blocks + Zsh + Spacemacs + Rofi + Neofetch]

I was struggling to find a Zsh theme and that had what I was looking for so I made my own theme using Powerlevel9k!

I then wrote my i3-gaps and i3blocks configs to look gorgeous and to make my workflow smoother.
